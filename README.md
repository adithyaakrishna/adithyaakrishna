A Software Engineer at [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com). I am a Frontend guy by day and a Distributed Systems fanboy by Night. I also work on AdobeXd and Figma designs often to keep the creative part of me alive :)

I am a [Google Season of Docs - GSoD '23](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs) Technical Writer at [WasmEdge](https://github.com/WasmEdge) working towards improving the Documentation of the project and onboarding contributors

I was also a [Google Summer of Code - GSoC '23](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) Developer at [OpenChemistry](https://openchemistry.org), and I worked on improving [3DMol.js](https://github.com/3dmol/3Dmol.js)

Maintainer of [Meshery](https://github.com/meshery) (a CNCF Sandbox Project), where I contribute quite often in areas of UI, GitHub Actions, docs, reviewing PRs and suggesting improvements.

A non-exhaustive list of things I like,

- ReactJS
- NextJS
- GoLang
- Zig (lately)
- Ceph (storage system)
- Databases
  - MongoDB
  - PostgreSQL
  - DragonFly
  - Tigerbeetle (lately)
- Kubernetes (Plus, OpenShift)
- Docker
- Meshery
- Istio (service mesh)
- Argo CI (huge fan of Akuity or as I call it, A Cutie :P)
