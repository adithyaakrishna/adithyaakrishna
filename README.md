### Hey! I'm Adithya Krishna 👋
I'm a Full-stack developer by day and a framework tinkerer by Night
  
I used to work as a SWE-II at [Documenso](https://documenso.com) for ~7 months. And before that, I started my career by working at [Red Hat](https://redhat.com) for ~2.5yrs wherein I worked with the Customer Portal team [https://access.redhat.com](https://access.redhat.com)

I was also a [Google Season of Docs - GSoD '23](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs) Technical Writer at [WasmEdge](https://github.com/WasmEdge) were I worked towards improving the Documentation of the project and onboarding contributors. And I was also a [Google Summer of Code - GSoC '23](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) Developer at [OpenChemistry](https://openchemistry.org), where I worked on improving [3DMol.js](https://github.com/3dmol/3Dmol.js) library

Maintainer of [Meshery](https://github.com/meshery) (a CNCF Sandbox Project), where I contribute quite often in areas of UI, GitHub Actions, docs, reviewing PRs and suggesting improvements.

A non-exhaustive list of things I like,

- ReactJS
- NextJS
- Prisma
- Zig (lately)
- Ceph (storage system)
- Databases
  - MongoDB
  - PostgreSQL
  - DragonFly
  - Tigerbeetle (lately)
- Kubernetes (Plus, OpenShift)
- Docker
- Meshery
- Istio (service mesh)
- Argo CI (huge fan of Akuity or as I call it, A Cutie :P)
